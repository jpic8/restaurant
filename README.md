# restaurant

This is my attempt at the Restaurant Page Project for The Odin Project:

This was a really fun project and my first encounter with Webpack. The Webpack documentation is quite good, and going through it and messing around a bit I was able to get a good grasp on the basic fundamentals. I'm sure I left some development settings on, and I'm not sure if I'm supposed to upload the entire project folder or just the dist directory.

Anyway, posting this initial commit so I can move on and not get stuck in the weeds messing with CSS all day. Will add a Github Pages link too.
